## shellcuts - directory shortcuts for your shell

Shellcuts allows you to jump between saved locations in your filesystem via a single, short command. Shellcuts can:

- create a named shellcut for any location in your filesystem
- add a follow-up command to any shellcut (like `ls` or `clear`)
- save a temporary "bread crumb" shellcut
- delete any shellcut by name
- list all available shellcuts

apt install ./shellcuts-*.deb
