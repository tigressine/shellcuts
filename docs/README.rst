- creates named shellcuts to any location in the filesystem
- lists all saved shellcuts
- deletes shellcuts by name
- saves shellcuts on a per-user basis
- supports Bashmarks syntax for user comfort and familiarity
- written mostly in Python for portability
- supports Bash shell
- installable via Pip_ (change this link to link to project page)

Planned features include:

- tab completion
- Fish, Zsh, Csh, Korn shell support
- installable via Apt, Homebrew
- possibly include z-like_ functionality
